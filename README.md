# tic-tac-toe
Basic Tic-tac-toe game made using HTML, CSS and Javascript based on the things i
have learnt through the odin [project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-tic-tac-toe)

Pressing the start button plays the game. The user is also able to optionally input
whatever text for both player one and two names. The restart button will reset the game state.
